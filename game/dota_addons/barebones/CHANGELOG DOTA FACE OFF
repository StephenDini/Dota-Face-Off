suggestions
---------------------

!sort store by int, agi, str
!allow custome guides
> interesting idea if it can be done. pay gold to get a reroll
!! scanning shows all vision


maybe give aura a decay and let the creep giving the aura longer time to broadcast aura
but shrink its radiaus and add one so both can have one.
